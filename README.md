# A simple electron todo app
This project served as a practical exercise for me with starting with Electron.

## Building the project
To build the project, you need to have node.js and electron-forge module installed. Open the project's folder in the terminal, install the dependencies using ``npm install``, and type ``npm run make`` which will build the binary files for the project based on your operating system. The build files will be located in the ``out`` folder.
